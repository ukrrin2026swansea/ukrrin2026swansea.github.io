  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <p>The UKRRIN Student Led Conference is the premier annual event for PhD students in the UK conducting research with applications in the railway industry. This conference will bring together members of the academic community and industry professionals to discuss innovative solutions and help shape the future of the railway.
