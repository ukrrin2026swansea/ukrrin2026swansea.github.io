      The UKRRIN Student Led Conference is the premier annual event for PhD
      students in the UK conducting research with applications in the railway
      industry. This conference will bring together members of the academic
      community and industry professionals to discuss innovative solutions and
      help shape the future of the railway. To this end, we will feature keynote
      speakers from leading organisations and provide networking opportunities
